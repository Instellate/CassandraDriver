# CassandraDriver
A C# driver made for experimenting.  
Why did you want to experiment with this? Cause I have never done anything in low TCP, so thougt this would be fun.  
This will try to be feature complete somewhere in the future. This includes client predition routing for clusters and stuff, but right now we just have a single way connection.


## Do you accept contributions?
Sure, why not. As long as it is quality code, even if this is a "experiment" I am still trying to optimise code as well as I know.
